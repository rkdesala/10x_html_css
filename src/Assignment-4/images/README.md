## Static Comp Challenge 1 - Backend Module 2

## Specification

This static comp challenge will keep you exercising that HTML/CSS muscle. :muscle: You will be asked to recreate the image below by recreating the screenshot using HTML and CSS.

In other static comp challenges (but not this one), we'll give you a bit of flexibility, however the objective is to build something that **very closely** represents the original design.

Once you get into the workforce, building out comps that reflect the designer's choice in layout, spacing, font, imagery, and color to the smallest detail, is a requirement.

## The Challenge

Your challenge is to recreate the following image using HTML and CSS. You've been given some initial files to get started that you must use.
